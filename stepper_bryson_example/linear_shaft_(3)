This code uses the adafruit_motor library to create a Servo object that can be used to control the servo's rotation. 
The PCA9685 class is used to drive the servo, and the Servo class provides a throttle property that can be set to control the servo speed and direction.

In this example, the actuation_range parameter is set to 360 to indicate that the servo can rotate continuously in either direction. 
The min_pulse and max_pulse parameters are set to 500 and 2500, respectively, 
to match the pulse width range of the Feedback 360 Degree - High Speed Continuous Rotation Servo.

To set the servo speed, simply set the throttle property to a value between -1.0 (full speed in one direction) 
and 1.0 (full speed in the other direction). A value of 0.0 corresponds to stopped.
