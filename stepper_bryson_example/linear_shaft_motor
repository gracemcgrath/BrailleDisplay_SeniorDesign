class Servo(_BaseServo):
    """Control the position of a servo.

       :param ~pwmio.PWMOut pwm_out: PWM output object.
       :param int actuation_range: The physical range of motion of the servo in degrees, \
           for the given ``min_pulse`` and ``max_pulse`` values.
       :param int min_pulse: The minimum pulse width of the servo in microseconds.
       :param int max_pulse: The maximum pulse width of the servo in microseconds.

       ``actuation_range`` is an exposed property and can be changed at any time:

        .. code-block:: python

          servo = Servo(pwm)
          servo.actuation_range = 135

       The specified pulse width range of a servo has historically been 1000-2000us,
       for a 90 degree range of motion. But nearly all modern servos have a 170-180
       degree range, and the pulse widths can go well out of the range to achieve this
       extended motion. The default values here of ``750`` and ``2250`` typically give
       135 degrees of motion. You can set ``actuation_range`` to correspond to the
       actual range of motion you observe with your given ``min_pulse`` and ``max_pulse``
       values.

       .. warning:: You can extend the pulse width above and below these limits to
         get a wider range of movement. But if you go too low or too high,
         the servo mechanism may hit the end stops, buzz, and draw extra current as it stalls.
         Test carefully to find the safe minimum and maximum.
